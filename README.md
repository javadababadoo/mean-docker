# MEAN DOCKER

This repo contains a simple project that uses the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node JS) to build a single page app (SPA) that could be easily configured and deployed with Docker and Docker compose.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

First, be sure that you have the following dependencies installed:

```
Docker - Available for Linux, Mac o Windows
```

Then, clone the repo from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/javadababadoo/mean-docker.git
cd mean-docker
```

### Directory structure
* backend/device-core - App backend source built with Node JS, Express and Mongoose.
* deployment/compose - Directory where its located the docker compose YAML file.
* frontend - App frontend source.
* scripts - Scripts used to populate the database.
* seed - Docker file that defines the instructions to seed the app.

Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
